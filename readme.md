# COURTESY BUS PROBLEM
Courtesy bus problem solvers:
- mathematical model (gurobi)
- heuristics
## Problem definition
There is a number of courtesy buses and a few customers. They have to be taken home 
(they've been in the PUB all day so they can't drive...).
They ask to be taken home after a certain time (time window lower bound).

GOAL: take all customers home. Optimise the cost of the route and the customers' satisfaction.
